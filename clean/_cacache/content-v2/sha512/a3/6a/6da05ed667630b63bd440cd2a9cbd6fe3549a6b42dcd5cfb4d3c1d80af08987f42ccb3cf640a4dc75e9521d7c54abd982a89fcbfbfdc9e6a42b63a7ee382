In a benchmark test using a 2448×3264, 2.2MB JPEG image, the decoding speed was measured as follows:\n\n```\nBenchmarked: small:  x 11,597 ops/sec ±0.60% (95 runs sampled)\nBenchmarked: medium:  x 11,219 ops/sec ±0.20% (98 runs sampled)\nBenchmarked: large:  x 7,744 ops/sec ±0.27% (100 runs sampled)\nBenchmarked: huge:  x 2,019 ops/sec ±0.36% (96 runs sampled)\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that the performance is significantly improved on smaller and simpler images.\n\n## License\n\n`jay-peg` is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["binary","jpeg","decode"]}
